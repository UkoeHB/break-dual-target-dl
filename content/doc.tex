\textbf{Analysis: Dual-Target Discrete Logarithm Assumption}\\

Arcturus \cite{arcturus} depends on a novel hardness assumption called the `dual-target discrete logarithm problem' (defined in the same paper). I demonstrate a break in that assumption.

Let the dual-target discrete logarithm challenger/adversary game play out as follows.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Challenger: define $G$ and $H$

    \item Adversary: randomly generate scalars $g_i$ and $h_i$ for $i = 0,...,n-1$. Define $G_i = g_i G$ and $H_i = h_i H$.

    \item Challenger: define $\mu^i$ for $i = 0,...,n-1$.

    \item Adversary: randomly generate scalars $x_i$ for $i = 2,...,n-1$. Define scalars $x_0$ and $x_1$ with the following procedure.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Note}: Adversary wants all of the following to be true. Challenger wants at least one to be false.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\sum \mu^i (G_i - x_i G) = I\)
    \item \(\sum \mu^i (H - x_i H_i) = I\)
    \item There exists an $0 \leq i < n$ such that either $x_i G \neq G_i$ or $x_i H_i \neq H$.
\end{itemize}

We can restate the first two conditions like this:
\begin{align}
    I &= \sum^{n - 1}_{i = 0} \mu^i * ( g_i - x_i) * G \\
    I &= \sum^{n - 1}_{i = 0} \mu^i*(1 - x_i * h_i) * H
\end{align}

Define the following variables (all terms are known constants):
\begin{align}
    \lambda_g &= \mu^0 g_0 + \mu^1 g_1 + \sum^{n - 1}_{i = 2} \mu^i * (g_i - x_i) \\
    \lambda_h &= \mu^0 + \mu^1 + \sum^{n - 1}_{i = 2} \mu^i * (1 - x_i * h_i)
\end{align}

If the following scalar equalities hold, then the previous elliptic curve equalities will also hold:
\begin{align}
    0 &= \lambda_g - \mu^0 x_0 - \mu^1 x_1 \\
    0 &= \lambda_h - \mu^0 x_0 h_0 - \mu^1 x_1 h_1
\end{align}

There are two equations and two unknowns ($x_0$ and $x_1$). Solve and get:
\begin{alignat}{3}
    x_1 &= &&(\lambda_h - h_0 \lambda_g)/[\mu^1 (h_1 - h_0)] \\
    x_0 &= -&&(\lambda_h - h_1 \lambda_g)/[\mu^0 (h_1 - h_0)]
\end{alignat}

Since $g_i$, $h_i$, and $x_i$ (for $i \neq 0, 1$) are random, there is no reason to expect the third game condition to fail every time (only if you are unlucky).
